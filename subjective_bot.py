    6. Testing on Your Own Sentence.

    You will write a python script that prompts the user for a sentence input on the command line, and prints the
    classification from each of the three models, as well as the probability that this sentence is subjective.

    An example console output:

        Enter a sentence
        What once seemed creepy now just seems campy

        Model baseline: subjective (0.964)
        Model rnn: subjective (0.999)
        Model cnn: subjective (1.000)

        Enter a sentence
